<p>Hello my name is Anthony Russell. Those that are currently looking at this page are seeing my first website built from scratch. I started taking an interest in web design back in 2012.
I was in graduate school during this time and working full-time, so I did not have the time to dedicate to it. It wouldn't until 2015 that I started to teach myself everything I could about programming basics. This eventually led me
to web design. This occurred after years of not being able to get into my career field with the three degrees and a minor I had acquired previously. 
These degrees were in<strong> Paralegal Studies, Criminal Justice, Public Administration, and Communications minor.</strong> My work experience includes medical and law offices, labs, contract assignments through temporary agencies, and retail stores. I decided that I had enough and sought a way break the cycle of moving from job to job.
 I began researching several different sites to teach myself the basics of web design until I stumbled across Khan Academy. I was able to get the core basics of web sign before moving onto more complex aspects. 
In order to create a website I knew I had to be proficient in the three core areas of web design,which are:<strong> HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</strong> <br> <p>I began studying the lesson plans every weekend due to my work schedule. Eventually I decided to use
my PTO time at work to take a week off in isolation to study whatever I could in order to make sure I had the core basics down.
	Currently I'm using a tutor to help ensure I fully understand the underlying factors of web design. I have a good understanding of both HTML and CSS, while still learning the basics of Javascript. This will be the first of a few different websites that will be made as I learn more concepts. I currently have four different clients that I will be making websites for which include a law firm, hair product business, multi-cultural center and a local musician. These sites will also be used
	in my professional profile to create work samples to put in my portfolio for recruiters. The end-goal is to be able to work in front-end development.<br> <p>
	In order to create this page I used the basic html format for <strong>html5</strong> with a character set of <strong>utf-8.</strong> 
	The header used a <strong>left</strong> text alignment with an adjusted background and text color. 
	I used an image profile from my facebook page with an adjusted height of <strong>120px</strong>, floating to the <strong>left</strong> of the page with right and left margins of <strong>10px.</strong> 
	Additionally the padding set used for the image was also <strong>10px.</strong> This combined with a border of <strong>2px</strong> allowed ideal spacing between the picture and the text. I also set a class for the text itself in order to allow and indentation of <strong>10px</strong> in the first sentence in each paragraph.
	The next step was to adjust the body background color by creating a class for the body of text and text color.
	This was also done for the header and the footnote at the bottom of the page in order to make the text stand out from the background.
